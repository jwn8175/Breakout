# Breakout

I wrote this game of breakout in 2019 for a project in high schoool.

If you want to try the game out, pull from ```master``` and run ```Breakout.main()```. It's playable, barely.

Currently working on reimplementing the entire code for this project as a side hobby. That work is in the ```reimp``` branch.
